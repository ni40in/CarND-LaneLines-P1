**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of the following steps:
 - convert the image to grayscale
 - apply Gaussian blur with kernel size 5
 - run Canny edge detection with brightness range from 50 to 150
 - apply a mask to select region of interest using defined vertices
 - detect lines using Hough transform
 - draw lines generated by Hough algorithm

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines():
 - grouped generated lines by their slope (lines sloping left were named "right" and vice versa), ignored vertical lines
 - calculated length for each line in both groups
 - picked 5 longest lines from each group to reduce the noise
 - calculated slope and offset for the longest lines and took mean values. this allows averaging all 5 lines into one
 - calculated start and end coordinates for the average lines
 - drawn 2 lines for left and right sides

Here is the result I obtained for a test image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

One of the shortcomings is that this algorithm is not working very well on dashed lines, it is clearly seen on videos. The line fit on the dashed lane line jiggles from one frame to another. I've tried stabilizing it by taking only the longest detected lines thus removing the noise, but there is still room for improvement.

Another problem is that current algorithm is not working on curved lanes. I think it can be addressed by fitting polynomials instead of straight lines.

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to apply smoothing by passing lines location from one video frame to another. This might help with reducing the jiggle.

Another improvement would be fitting polynomials to work on curved lines.
